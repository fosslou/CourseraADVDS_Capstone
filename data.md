# Data Sources

In order to determine the best place to live and the eating establishments in Baltimore, Ben needs to identify some data sources for his analysis

## Crime data
Baltimore City provides a large amount of city data at its https://data.baltimorecity.gov/ website.  This website has data available such as crime data which is updated daily.  Specifically we will be using the crime data located at URL: https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/wsfq-mvij/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD

## Venue Data (Eateries and Schools)
Foursquare is a service that provides crowdsourced information about various venues in a geographic format.  In this case we will be using the foursquare API to pull information about Italian Eateries, and Schools in Baltimore City.
