# Introduction

InfoDyne Corporation is considering relocating its manufacturing operations from China to a location in the United States.  InfoDyne's main customers are farmers worldwide which use its data acquistion and transmission products to improve crop yields.    The State of Maryland and the United States Federal Government are offering tax incentives and loan guarantees to companies that relocate their businesses to cities that traditionally have high crime.

InfoDyne management has asked its data science team to investigate the City of Baltimore in Maryland to identify a location that has acceptable crime rates along with access to the interstate highway system and ports for shipment.  Additionally, if this project is successful, Infodyne would like a location identified that has expansion opportunities.

## Problem

Baltimore City is problematic.  Many areas are unsuitable for relocation because the crime rate is so high, that employees would refuse to work in that part of the city.  In addition, a workforce would need access to facilities such as food, gas, and other conveniences that may not be available in certain places in the city.

## Interest

InfoDyne Management is interested in this because of the ongoing trade war with China and multiple instances of intellectual property theft which has bolstered Chinese competitors at the expense of InfoDyne.  In addition, InfoDyne Research has new data acquistion products, in development,  that could revolutionize the use of data in agriculture and wants to build these new products within the USA to protect its intellectual property.
